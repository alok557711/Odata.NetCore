# Odata.NetCore
OData is an open source, open protocol technology that provides the ability to API developers to develop Queryable APIs, one of the most common things API developers need is pagination for instance.

With OData you can enable pagination, ordering of data, reshaping and restructuring of the data and much more with only 4 lines of code.

One of the most common scenarios today is when developers call an endpoint and pull out data that they are going to filter, reshape and order later on the client side. This seems a bit wasteful. especially if the data is large enough that could cause latency and require further optimizations for a better user experience.
